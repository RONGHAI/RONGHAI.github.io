####Java Programmer

I'm  Ronghai Wei and I am a Java Programmer with 7 years of experience.  Currently I'm working for Lake 5 Media that is a media analytic software company. 

As one of the best programmers in Lake 5 Media, I design a new inner-framework for developing and a series of development tools.


####Father

My 2-year-old is a little girl. She is an important person in my life.  I love her forever.
